My first Jekyll post. It seems very simple and quick to update. For installing and starting up see [Mac installation]. In order to install the latest version og Jekyll to ubuntu/mint first download the Ruby version 2 or higher as follows:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ruby2.0 ruby2.0-dev
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/ruby ruby /usr/bin/ruby2.0 2
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gem gem /usr/bin/gem2.0 2
```
then you can install jykell as follows

```bash
gem install jekyll
```

Also deployed to github at https://daghanacay.github.io/. See for instructions [github deployment instructions]
